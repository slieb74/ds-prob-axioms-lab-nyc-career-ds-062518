    "Now that you know what sets are, we can go on and work with two sets that are of key importance when talking about probability: the event space and the sample space. These two concepts are foundational for calculating probabilities when assuming each event in the event space *has a same probability of happening*. Typical examples are rolling a dice (if the dice is \"fair\", the chance of throwing each number between 1 and 6 is 1/6) and flipping a coin (1/2 heads vs tails). You'll get a better sense of how all of this works in this lab."
